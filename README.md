# Assembly for the 6502 processor

## 🎬 Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of my learning journey through this course! Here, I'll cover the motivations behind diving
into the world of assembly language and what I aim to achieve. This isn't just about learning syntax—it's about
unlocking a deeper understanding of how computers work at their core.

To give you an idea of the journey ahead, here are some Atari 2600 graphics:

## 💡 Motivations

Why did I choose to learn assembly language? Here are some of the main reasons that pushed me to take on this challenge:

## Course description (copied from Udemy)

Are you feeling a bit lost in this fast-paced jungle that is the world of software development today?
Do you need some refreshing vacation where you learn something really small, nerdy, and fun?

Well, book your tickets!
This course will teach you the basics of programming games for the classic Atari 2600 console using 6502 Assembly Language. If you are a complete beginner 
or if you are a pro developer, chances are you will learn something new and enjoy poking the bytes of a simple and minimal 
hardware architecture that is the classic Atari 2600 VCS.

Join me if you want to:
    - Expand your knowledge of computer architecture and low-level programming
    - Understand what happens under the hood when you write something as simple as print("Hello World") in your favorite high-level language
    - Learn to code game elements for the Atari 2600 system using 6502 assembly language.
    - Create your own Atari ROM cartridges and run them with an Atari emulator

There are no real requirements to this course and beginners are welcomed. You only need to know how to work with computers,
copy files around, and a code editor.

### 🔍 **Deeper Understanding of How Computers Operate:**

It's easy to get comfortable with high-level programming, but I want to know what's really happening under the hood.
Learning assembly will help me gain insights into the basic operations that drive every software program.

###  ⚙️ **Bridging the Gap Between Software and Hardware:**

I’m curious about how the code I write gets translated into machine-level instructions.

Assembly serves as the bridge between the human-readable code I’m used to and the binary instructions executed by the CPU,
but understanding completely what the code that I write is doing is something that always worried me. Fully understand the code
you write gives you tons of power about the architectural designs that you can follow, how to write **clean code** and efficient code...
without having to choose between them... So I can add this motivations to the list:
    - Recognize the reasons behind certain compiler optimizations or inefficiencies.
    - Make better decisions when writing high-level code by considering how it translates to assembly.
    - Use tools like Compiler Explorer to compare different implementations and understand their impact on generated machine code.

### 🚀 **Optimizing Performance:**
Knowing how to write assembly can make a huge difference in optimizing code for speed and efficiency.
This skill is especially valuable in performance-critical areas like game development, embedded systems, or low-level OS programming.

### 🛠️ **Gaining a New Perspective on Debugging:**
High-level programming often abstracts away the gritty details, but I want to be equipped to solve problems that go
beyond stack traces and error logs.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After going through this course, here’s what I expect to take away:

- 🧠 A clearer understanding of why learning assembly is worthwhile.
- 🔎 The ability to recognize situations where low-level programming knowledge could provide an edge.
- 🎓 The ability to fluently read the assembly instructions generated for compilers and assemblers in other languages
- 🏆 Confidence in approaching complex systems with a low-level perspective.

## 📈 What's Next?

The upcoming lessons will start breaking down key concepts in computer architecture before diving into the core aspects of assembly language.
I'm looking forward to understanding the nuts and bolts of what makes a computer tick!
